 <p>In 1958, the two companies began a partnership to sell their cars in the
      United States with Studebaker. A few American-based Daimler Benz
      dealerships were converted into Mercedes-Benz dealerships when Daimler's
      non-Mercedes-partnered company closed in 1966.

    <p> From 1937 onward, Daimler Benz focused increasingly on military products
      such as the LG3000 lorry and the DB600 and the DB601 aero engines. To
      build the latter, in 1936, it built a factory hidden in the forest at
      Genshagen around 10 km south of Berlin. By 1942, the company had mostly
      stopped producing cars, and was now devoted to war production. According
      to its statement, in 1944, almost half of its 63,610 employees were forced
      labourers, prisoners of war, or concentration-camp detainees. Another
      source quotes this figure at 46,000. The company later paid $12 million in
      reparations to the labourers'
