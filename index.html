        Mercedes-Benz-badged heavy commercial vehicles are managed by Daimler
        Truck, a former part of the Mercedes-Benz Group turned into an
        independent company in late 2021.<br />
        In 2018, Mercedes-Benz was the largest brand of premium vehicles in the
        world, having sold 2.31 million passenger cars.<br />

        The brand's origins lie in Daimler-Motoren-Gesellschaft's 1901 Mercedes
        and Carl Benz's 1886 Benz Patent-Motorwagen,<br />
        which is widely regarded as the first internal combustion engine in a
        self-propelled automobile. The slogan for the brand is "the best or
        nothing".

        Mercedes-Benz traces its origins to Karl Benz first internal combustion
        engine in a car, seen in the Benz Patent Motorwagen financed by Bertha
        Benz's dowry and patented in January 1886,<br />and Gottlieb Daimler and
        their engineer Wilhelm Maybach's conversion of a stagecoach, with the
        addition of a petrol engine, introduced later that year.<br />
        The Mercedes automobile was first marketed in 1901 by Daimler Motoren
        Gesellschaft.
